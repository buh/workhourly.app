        <p class="subtitle">Effective Date: January 1, 2025</p>
        
        <p>Your privacy is fundamental to WorkHourly. We built our app to work <span class="highlight">without collecting any personal data</span>.</p>

            <li>Data syncs through <strong>your private iCloud account</strong></li>
            <li>Only you can access it with your Apple ID</li>
            <li>Data is encrypted in transit and at rest</li>
            <li>We cannot see or access your iCloud data</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>4. Permissions We Request</h2>

        <p><strong>No Other Third Parties:</strong> We don't use any analytics, crash reporting, or advertising services.</p>
        
        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>If we update this policy, we'll notify you through the app. Your continued use constitutes acceptance.</p>
        
        <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Since we don't collect data, traditional data rights (access, deletion, portability) don't apply. Your data is already under your full control.</p>
