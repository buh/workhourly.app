  "FAQ_Q13": "What's included in the analytics?",
  "FAQ_A13": "See which clients are most profitable, your productive days, work consistency patterns. Charts reveal trends: which days you work longest, which clients pay best. Business intelligence for smarter scheduling decisions.",

  "FAQ_A15": "Schedule Mode (plan shifts, mark complete when done) or Clock In/Out Mode (real-time timer with live earnings). Either mode lets you schedule future shifts and add past work. Switch anytime in Settings - it's just your preferred interface for today's work.",
