  "FAQ_Q1": "What makes WorkHourly different from other time trackers?",
  "FAQ_A1": "Most time trackers are built for employees or single projects. WorkHourly is designed specifically for service professionals who juggle multiple clients with different rates and schedules. We handle the real-world complexity of your work: tracking expenses per job (not just per day), documenting work with photos, automatically detecting overtime, and generating professional invoices that actually get you paid. Everything works offline-first, so whether you're in a basement or on a rooftop, your time tracking never stops.",
  "FAQ_Q2": "Is WorkHourly suitable for my type of work?",
  "FAQ_A2": "If you're wondering \"Is this for someone like me?\" the answer is probably yes. Babysitters juggling three families, handymen with a mix of hourly and project work, tutors teaching different subjects at different rates, cleaners managing weekly and monthly clients - WorkHourly gets it. The common thread isn't what you do, it's how you work: multiple clients, different rates, variable schedules, and the need to get paid accurately for every minute. That's exactly who we built this for.",
  "FAQ_Q3": "Can I track expenses for each job separately?",
  "FAQ_A3": "Absolutely, and this is where WorkHourly really shines. Most apps lump expenses together by day, but that's not how real work happens. When you fix Mrs. Johnson's sink in the morning and then repair the Smith's deck in the afternoon, those expenses need to stay separate. WorkHourly tracks expenses per work shift, so each client's materials, travel, and costs are crystal clear on their invoice. Snap photos of receipts, add descriptions - everything stays organized exactly how your business actually works.",
  "FAQ_Q4": "How do the smart reminders work?",
  "FAQ_A4": "Smart reminders work like having a personal assistant who actually understands your schedule. Get a gentle morning notification about today's work, then WorkHourly watches the clock for you. No internet required - these reminders are scheduled right on your phone, so they work even in the middle of nowhere.",
  "FAQ_Q5": "How does it work without internet?",
  "FAQ_A5": "Your data lives on your phone, not on some server halfway around the world. Track time, log expenses, generate invoices - it all works perfectly whether you have WiFi, cellular, or no connection at all. This isn't just convenient; it's essential when you're working in basements, rural areas, or anywhere service calls take you. Pro users can add iCloud backup for peace of mind, but your work never stops for a weak signal.",
  "FAQ_Q6": "What's included in the analytics?",
  "FAQ_A6": "Think of analytics as your business coach that never sleeps. See which clients actually make you money (not just the ones who pay the most per hour), discover your most productive days, and track how consistently you're working. The charts show you patterns you might miss day-to-day: \"I always work longer on Wednesdays\" or \"My Tuesday clients are my most profitable.\" It's like having a bird's-eye view of your entire business, helping you make smarter decisions about where to spend your time.",
  "FAQ_Q7": "How does overtime calculation work?",
  "FAQ_A7": "Overtime calculation is where WorkHourly really pays for itself. Set your regular rate and overtime rate for each client - maybe the Johnsons pay 1.5x after 8 hours, but your commercial client pays double time for weekend work. The app asks you to set your actual end time when your scheduled work finishes, so if you worked late, WorkHourly catches every extra minute and calculates it at the right rate automatically. No more lost money because you forgot to track that extra hour, or because you couldn't remember which client pays what for overtime.",
  "FAQ_Q8": "Is my data safe with iCloud backup?",
  "FAQ_A8": "Your data goes straight from your phone to your personal iCloud account - we never see it, touch it, or have any access to it. Think of it like having a private safety deposit box that only you hold the key to. Apple handles all the encryption and security, so your client information, earnings, and work details stay completely private. Even if you lose your phone or get a new one, everything syncs back exactly as you left it. And remember, everything works offline first, so your data is always safe on your device regardless of internet.",
  "FAQ_Q9": "Can I try Pro features before buying?",
  "FAQ_A9": "The free version isn't a teaser - it's a complete time tracking solution for one client. Track hours, log expenses, add notes and photos, everything works perfectly. Most people start here and realize WorkHourly just makes sense. When your business grows and you're juggling multiple clients, that's when Pro features like unlimited clients and PDF invoicing become essential. You can try Pro free for two weeks, or go straight to lifetime if you know you've found your solution.",
  "FAQ_Q10": "How do widgets work on my home screen?",
  "FAQ_A10": "WorkHourly Schedule widgets show your upcoming work shifts right on your home screen and Lock Screen. They automatically update with live countdowns - \"In 3 hours\" becomes \"In 2 hours\" without you doing anything. Available in Small, Medium, and Lock Screen sizes to fit your preference.",
  "FAQ_Q11": "Can I set different pay rates for different clients?",
  "FAQ_A11": "This is where WorkHourly really understands your business. Every client is different - the family you babysit for pays $20/hour, the restaurant you clean pays $1200/month, and your weekend handyman client pays $35/hour with double time after 6 PM. Set up each client's unique payroll contract once, and WorkHourly handles all the math automatically. Different rates, different overtime rules, different tax situations - it all just works, no matter how complex your client mix gets.",
  "FAQ_Q12": "What happens if I forget to track my time?",
  "FAQ_A12": "Life happens - phones die, you get distracted, or you simply forget to start the timer. WorkHourly doesn't punish you for being human. Just tap \"Add Work\" anytime and fill in what you remember: which client, when you started, when you finished. WorkHourly figures out the hours, calculates any overtime, and slots it perfectly into your timeline. You can even add expenses and notes to work you did weeks ago. Your memory might be fuzzy, but your paycheck doesn't have to be.",
  "FAQ_Q13": "How do I add photos to document my work?",
  "FAQ_A13": "Sometimes a picture really is worth a thousand words - especially when a client questions your invoice later. On any work day, tap the three dots menu and select \"Add a picture\" to reveal the Pictures section. Then tap the plus button to choose between \"Take Photo\" with your camera or \"Choose from Library\" to select existing photos. Before and after shots prove the work was done, receipt photos keep expense tracking honest, and progress pics help clients see their money at work. Everything stays private on your phone. It's like having a professional photo gallery for every job you complete.",
  "FAQ_Q14": "How accurate are the earnings calculations?",
  "FAQ_A14": "WorkHourly doesn't round down or \"estimate\" - it calculates every minute you've earned. Work 3 hours and 45 minutes? That's exactly what gets calculated, not \"about 4 hours.\" Mix a 2-hour morning job with an 8-hour afternoon client that includes overtime? WorkHourly handles the complexity without breaking a sweat. All the math happens right on your phone using algorithms we've tested with thousands of real-world scenarios. When tax time comes, or when a client questions an invoice, you can trust every number completely."
